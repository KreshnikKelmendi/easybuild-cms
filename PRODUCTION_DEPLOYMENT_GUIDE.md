# üöÄ Production Deployment Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide will help you deploy your EasyBuild Next.js application to production with working image uploads using Cloudinary.

## üîë Prerequisites

### 1. Cloudinary Account Setup
1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and create a free account
2. From your dashboard, note down:
   - **Cloud Name**
   - **API Key** 
   - **API Secret**

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
MONGODB_DB_NAME=easybuild

# Next.js Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials!

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add all the environment variables from your `.env.local` file

4. **Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Drag and drop your `.next` folder to Netlify
   - Or use Netlify CLI

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add all required environment variables

### Option 3: Traditional VPS/Server

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** in your production environment

3. **Use PM2 or similar** for process management

## üîß Configuration Steps

### 1. Verify Cloudinary Setup
Run the configuration check:
```bash
node check-cloudinary.js
```

### 2. Test Image Uploads
1. Deploy your application
2. Go to the admin panel (`/dashboard`)
3. Try uploading an image
4. Check the browser console for any errors

### 3. Monitor Uploads
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for uploaded images
- Verify images are accessible via their URLs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "All upload locations are inaccessible"
**Cause**: The app is trying to use local file storage instead of Cloudinary
**Solution**: 
- Ensure all admin components use `/api/upload-image-cloudinary`
- Verify Cloudinary environment variables are set correctly

#### Issue: "Cloudinary credentials are invalid"
**Cause**: Wrong or missing API credentials
**Solution**:
- Double-check your Cloudinary credentials
- Ensure they're set in your production environment
- Verify the credentials work in the Cloudinary dashboard

#### Issue: Images not displaying
**Cause**: Next.js image optimization not configured for Cloudinary
**Solution**: 
- Ensure `res.cloudinary.com` is in your `next.config.ts` remote patterns
- Check that image URLs are accessible

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   node check-cloudinary.js
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoint**:
   Visit `/api/debug-env` in your production app

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   Look for detailed error messages during upload

4. **Verify Cloudinary Dashboard**:
   Check if images are actually being uploaded

2. **API Keys**: Keep your Cloudinary API keys secure
3. **CORS**: Configure CORS properly for your domain
4. **File Validation**: Ensure only images are uploaded

## üìä Monitoring
